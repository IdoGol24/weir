## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-17

First public cut.

### Added
- Seam-1 CanonicalTrace schema (1.1.0) with committed JSON-Schema artifact.
- OTel GenAI OTLP-JSON adapter (dialect-pinned otel-genai/1.42.0): reject-narrow
  ingestion with an 18-row named degradation contract (docs/contract.md),
  evidence-tiered joins (explicit > nested > content-mined; heuristic never
  assigned), JSONL/array/document input, permissive wire scalars.
- `weir gauge` evidentiary-coverage report with capability ladder and
  `--sample` zero-setup demo; `weir scan` with witness-path finding blocks
  and CI exit-code contract (0/1/2, test-backed).
- Paired synthetic generator (weir-tracegen): presets, degradation dials,
  corrupt corpus, byte-for-byte adapter equivalence acceptance.
- Foreign protojson JSONL capture fixture with derived ledger snapshot.
- Determinism (G1) and no-network (G3) harnesses; four import-linter
  contracts; remediation-source audit with drift pin.
